Matcher
=======

####What is this?
Matcher is a terminal based ruby application for to perform double-blind settlement negotation.
#####What's that?
In a double blind negotiation, neither side knows the other's offer unless certain conditions are met.  In matcher, the condition is that the "ceiling" must be greater than the "floor."
#####How do I use it?
If you use a mac, Ruby is built in.  Download the file, type `ruby match.rb` and follow the directions.
######Why bother?
I've found that the approach works really well in litigation, and saves people time and money.  A much fancier implementation can be found at www.impassebreaker.com.  I was curious how this would look if it were really simple, and what others might do with the idea.
